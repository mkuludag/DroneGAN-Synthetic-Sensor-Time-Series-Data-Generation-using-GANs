DroneGAN: Synthetic Sensor Time Series Data Generation using GANs
License

Overview
The DroneGAN repository provides a solution for generating synthetic time series data for drone sensor readings using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The goal of this project is to produce realistic sensor data that can be used for various purposes, such as training and testing machine learning models, simulating different scenarios, and augmenting existing datasets.

Features
Utilize GANs to generate drone sensor time series data with realistic patterns and distributions.
Configurable architecture and hyperparameters to customize the data generation process.
Support for different types of sensors commonly found in drones, such as GPS, IMU, LiDAR, and more.
Pre-processing and data augmentation techniques to enhance the quality and diversity of generated data.
Sample code and notebooks demonstrating how to use the generated data in machine learning tasks.
Installation
To use the DroneGAN library, follow these steps for installation:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DroneGAN-Synthetic-Sensor-Time-Series-Data-Generation-using-GANs.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Navigate to the cloned repository:
bash
Copy code
cd DroneGAN-Synthetic-Sensor-Time-Series-Data-Generation-using-GANs
Modify the configuration file to specify the desired data characteristics and GAN parameters.

Run the data generation script:

bash
Copy code
python generate_data.py
The generated synthetic data will be saved in the designated output directory.
